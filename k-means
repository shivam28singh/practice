K-means algorithm is an part of unsupervised learning where in our dataset we do not have a label for our observed example and we have to 
find the clusters(group of similar types),so that we can categorise our dataset into the different clusters and these clusters gives us the 
appropriate information regarding our datasets.

Algorithm:-
  It contains two main steps:
  1) Initialize each data points to some cluster(only those clusters will assigned to it which has a minimum distance from that clusters
     centroids to the data points).
  2) update the cluster centroids of every clusters (by taking the mean of data points which belongs to the same clusters).
